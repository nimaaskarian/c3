```

If you use **Arch linux**, You can install [c3 from AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/c3). Installation using yay would be
```bash
yay -S c3
```
### Using a pre-built release
You can check out [releases](https://github.com/nimaaskarian/c3/releases).
Also if you use **Arch linux**, you can install a pre-built binary [from AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/c3-bin). Installation using yay would be

```

## Usage
### Interactive mode
The default mode of the app is TUI mode. Keybinds are vim-like. Here they are:

| key | action |
|---|---|
| a | add todo to bottom|
| A | add todo to top|
| space | toggle todo done |
| e | edit todo |
| E | edit todo (move cursor to start) |
| ! | toggle show done |
| 0-9 | set todo priority |
| j | go down in todo list |
| k | go up in todo list |
| g | go top of todo list |
| G | go bottom of todo list |
| J | increase todo priority |
| K | decrease todo priority |
| @ | restrict todos by priority |
| % | restrict todos by schedule day |
| d | toggle daily |
| W | toggle weekly |
| S | set custom schedule |
| m | Set todo as a reminder
| D | delete todo |
| > | add todo note |
| i | increase day done |
| I | increase day done |
| t | add todo dependency |
| l, enter | go in depedency/add todo dependency |
| h | go back to parent |
| T | delete todo dependency/note |
| x | cut todo to clipboard |
| y | yank todo to clipboard |
| p | paste todo from clipboard |
| P | enable module |
| / | search current list for todo |
| ? | search the whole tree for todo (tree search) |
| F | search the tree from current list using [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)  |
| n | tree search next |
| o | open nnn file picker to choose a file to append to current list |
| O | open nnn file picker to choose a file to output current list to |
| Ctrl+o | open nnn file picker to choose a file to open |
| Ctrl+d | sort by todo's abandonment (how hasn't been done compared to their schedule) |
| Ctrl+z | suspend (send current c3 to background, only in *nix) |
| w | write changes to file |
| R | read from file (discard changes)|

#### [potato-c](https://github.com/nimaaskarian/potato-c) module keybinds
| key | action |
|---|---|
| s | skip current |
| H | increase timer |
| L | decrease timer |
| +,= | increase pomodoro count |
| - | decrease pomodoro count |
| c | toggle pause |
| C | quit |
| f | restart |
| . | next server |
| , | prev server |

### Non interactive mode
For command line arguments and such, run `c3 -h` to see full usage.

## Performance
If you're experiencing performance issues on very large todo lists (I begin to experience it with 500k todos, which can seem like a lot),
you can use `--minimal-render` and `--no-tree` cli options. Also use `?` (tree) search instead of the normal search.
